The robotics was a lot of fun, and opening the Kibo (JEM - Japanese Experiment Module) and flying in there for the first time was really something.
At first it did not have any panels or racks installed, and so we had most of the cylindrical volume open.
It was, and still is, by far, the largest and most open volume within the station.
For a few wild and crazy minutes we had 10 people flying around in all directions.
Then back to work, and the next several days involved installing system and science racks, hooking everything up to cooling, power, data, air-flow, etc.

The space station is a huge and very impressive facility that we humans have somehow managed to build.
There's no doubt that building this space station is one of humanitys greatest achievements.
Despite working on it for 15 years, and knowing what every part of it looks like in great detail, I felt like I was seeing it for the very first time.
It was the real thing - not a mock-up, not a simulation, not a picture, but another spaceship, a huge one, flying in formation with us in space.
How cool is that? Wow! Incredible. It felt like we were in a movie. What could be more cool than this?
Well, opening the hatches and being greeted, not by space aliens, but by some of your best friends.
